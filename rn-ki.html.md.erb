## Version 1.0.10
**Release Date: July 15, 2016**

### Notes
* PCF Metrics 1.0.10 - BUG FIX: Corrects issue in 1.0.9 where the UI errand was not properly bumped to CLI v6.19, causing UI push to fail in some environments.

### Known issues
* For applications that do not have any activity in the past 24 hours (which means no app events or http requests have been generated), users will not see any data in the UI. They will also need to refresh their browser after metrics are generated by the use of the app.
* While installing the PCF Metrics tile, the default Resource Config settings for each resource pool may be over-sized for POC/Beta purposes. You may adjust them manually to fit your environment. 
* All v1.0.x tiles - if you see apps dropdown grayed out
    * Because of an earlier CLI bug, we have seen PCF metrics apps missing system org guid during tile upgrade/uninstall process which crashes PCF Metrics UI and makes the apps dropdown inaccessible. This is fixed in 1.1 Metrics tile. A work around for this to remove the user's access to system org using CLI.
* All v1.0.x tiles - if you don't see some apps in the dropdown even though they are accessible in apps manager
    * If you have apps manager/console admin privilege, you may be able to see apps in apps manager without having space developer role privilege to the spaces in which those apps reside. Metrics however follows permissions directly form cloud controller so if you have cloud.controller.admin privilege, you can see all apps in all spaces in all orgs in PCF Metrics UI. If you have space developer privilege to certain spaces then you can only see the apps in those spaces in PCF Metrics UI.  

## Version 1.0.9
**Release Date: July 1, 2016**

### Notes
* PCF Metrics 1.0.9 - now with stemcell 3232.12. Release also bumps required CLI to CLI v6.19.

### Known issues
* BUG IDENTIFIED: An errand was missed when requiring the CLI v6.19 bump, leaving the UI push errand still on v6.18.1. This bug has caused the UI push to fail in some environments. Metrics v1.0.10 corrects. 
* For applications that do not have any activity in the past 24 hours (which means no app events or http requests have been generated), users will not see any data in the UI. They will also need to refresh their browser after metrics are generated by the use of the app.
* While installing the PCF Metrics tile, the default Resource Config settings for each resource pool may be over-sized for POC/Beta purposes. You may adjust them manually to fit your environment. 

## Version 1.0.8
**Release Date: June 23, 2016**

### Notes
* This release fixes a route issue in prior versions of PCF Metrics v1.0 where you could receive a "404 Not Found: Requested route does not exist in PCF Metrics" error.

### Known issues
* For applications that do not have any activity in the past 24 hours (which means no app events or http requests have been generated), users will not see any data in the UI. They will also need to refresh their browser after metrics are generated by the use of the app.
* While installing the PCF Metrics tile, the default Resource Config settings for each resource pool may be over-sized for POC/Beta purposes. You may adjust them manually to fit your environment. 
* No direct upgrade path. Operators can delete the installed tile and install the new tile.  This does result in downtime and data loss.

### Known Issues
* Route mappings for `metrics.<system_domain>` and `metrics.<system_domain>/v2` may be overwritten or incorrectly mapped during redeploys.
* For applications that do not have any activity in the past 24 hours (which means no app events or http requests have been generated), users will not see any data in the UI. They will also need to refresh their browser after metrics are generated by the use of the app.
