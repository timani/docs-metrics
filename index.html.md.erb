The Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; (PCF) Metrics tile stores metrics data from applications running on PCF and graphically presents that data for operators and developers. PCF Metrics helps operators and developers better understand the health and performance of their apps by providing a near real-time view of the following data:

* Container metrics: CPU, memory, and disk percentages (updated every 30 seconds)
* Network metrics: requests per second, HTTP errors per second, and request latency (updated every second)
* App events: create, update, start, stop, and crash (updated as they happen)

## <a id='install'></a>Installing PCF Metrics 

### <a id='pre-reqs'></a>Prerequisites

Ensure that you have installed the [Elastic Runtime Tile](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/installing/index.html).

### <a id='step1'></a> Step 1: Add the PCF Metrics Tile to Ops Manager

1. Download the PCF Metrics file from
   [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pcf-metrics).
1. Upload the PCF Metrics file to your Ops Manager installation.
1. Click **Add** next to the uploaded product description in the **Available Products**
   view to add PCF Metrics to your **Installation Dashboard**.

### <a id='step2'></a>Step 2: Configure the PCF Metrics Tile

From the **Installation Dashboard**, click the **PCF Metrics** tile.

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> The tile is orange because it requires configuration.</p>

#### Assign Availability Zones (AZs) and Networks.

1. Click **Assign AZs and Networks**.
1. Select an Availability Zone under **Place singleton jobs**. 
   <br>
   Ops Manager runs Metrics jobs with a single instance in this Availability Zone.
1. Select one or more Availability Zones under **Balance other jobs**. 
   <br>
   Ops Manager balances instances of Metrics jobs with more than one instance
   across the Availability Zones that you specify.
1. Use the drop-down menu to select a network.
1. Click **Save**.

#### Resource Config

1. Click **Resource Config**.
1. Review the resource configurations. By default, the settings match the instance types that are best suited for each job. If you expect a high level of use, you may need to increase the disk resources available to your instances.
1. Click **Save**. 

#### Stemcell

1. Navigate to [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io) and click **Stemcells**.
1. Download the appropriate stemcell version for your IaaS.
   <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> On AWS make sure to use a HVM stemcell if you are using the default instance sizes.</p>
1. Click **Import Stemcell** and select the stemcell file you downloaded.

### <a id='step3'></a>Step 3: Deploy PCF Metrics

Click **Apply Changes** to install the service. Review the [Using PCF Metrics](using.html) topic for more information on how to log in, use, and interpret data from PCF Metrics.
